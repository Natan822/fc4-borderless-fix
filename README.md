## Far Cry 4 Borderless Fix
This is a Far Cry 4 mod that aims to fix a bug in borderless mode that causes 
the game to "zoom in" on the top-left of the screen. These are a few examples
of this bug: 
- [Farcry 4 Borderless window zooms in my game , help](https://linustechtips.com/topic/266181-farcry-4-borderless-window-zooms-in-my-game-help/)
- [borderless mode resolution bug?](https://steamcommunity.com/app/298110/discussions/0/154644705025588180/)

Another solution to this problem is to simply Alt+Enter, which makes the game fullscreen
and essentially fixes that issue. However, when you Alt+Tab while in fullscreen mode, the game 
goes back to Borderless, requiring you to Alt+Enter again, which is an inconvenience... a minor
one, but an inconvenience. So I decided to try and make this mod.

### Usage
1. Download and extract the files from the latest [release](https://github.com/Natan822/fc4-borderless-fix/releases) into `Far Cry 4/bin` or wherever
FarCry4.exe is located for you.
2. Open `borderless-fix.ini`.
3. Change the width and height values to match your screen resolution.  
``Warning: Setting these values to lower than your screen resolution will cause the game
to crash on startup.``
4. Open the game.
